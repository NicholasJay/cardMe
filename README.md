##### An application that allows you to easily share your business card with anyone. 

  * When a user signs up for a cardMe account they can create a customizable business card.
  * Once logged in a user is taken to their dashboard containing 2 input fields at the top.
    - One field will automatically send a text message link to their business card to any phone
    - The other field will automatically email their business card to any email address with an image of the business card that acts as a link to their cardMe page
  * When a user visits another users business card they have the option to add that card to their personal rolodex
